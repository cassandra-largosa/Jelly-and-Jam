# Clod's Quest
Ludum Dare 42: Running out of space

You're a clod. 

No, literally, you're a lump of earth. 

A ball of mud. Sentient mud.

What *is* important is that you're on a quest- 

a transformative journey- to become shinier. 

You must collect every fragment of the 

**P H I L O S O P H E R ' S   S T O N E** 

to make your muddy dreams come true. 

Will you be able to navigate the rooms 

while managing your ever fluctuating size 

and avoid danger?
